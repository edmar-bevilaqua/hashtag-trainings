The objective for Challenge 2 in this module (Flexbox in CSS) is to add everything we've learned about layout building in this module.

Remember that with Flexbox we can adjust several things:

Direction
Positioning
Alignment
Spacing
Size
Order

We're almost done with the Hashtag Home. Let's go all in!

Have fun!
